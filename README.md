     - `IPoolable`: Interface for poolable objects
   - Usage:
     ```csharp
     // Create a new pool
     var pool = new ObjectPool<DebugMarker>(prefab, transform);
     
     // Get an object from pool
     var obj = pool.Get();
     
     // Return object to pool
     obj.ReturnToPool();
     ```
