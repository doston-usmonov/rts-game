# RTS Game Development Project

A real-time strategy game inspired by Command & Conquer: Generals - Zero Hour, built with modern game development practices.

## Project Overview
This game features three unique factions, real-time combat mechanics, and strategic base building elements.

### Key Features
- Multiple unique factions with distinct playstyles (Technological, Heavy Assault, and Guerrilla)
- Strategic base building and resource management
- Real-time combat system with advanced unit mechanics
- Multiplayer support
- Dynamic terrain analysis system

## Technical Stack
- Game Engine: Unity (C#)
- Backend: Node.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Multiplayer: Photon Engine
- 3D Modeling: Blender
- Audio: FMOD
